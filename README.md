# About

The electrologic UUID library is a simple library for processing UUIDs.
It has been created as the UUID class bundled in the JRE is not capable of generating the new variants described in this [RFC draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format-04.html) draft.
While only the [RFC 4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122) variant is implemented, other variants could be added if there is the need for it.
