# About

The electrologic UUID library is a simple library for processing UUIDs.
It has been created as the UUID class bundled in the JRE is not capable of generating the new variants described in this [https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format-04.html](RFC draft) draft.
While only the RFC 4122 variant is implemented, other variants could be added if there is the need for it.
