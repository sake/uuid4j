 * This class is a time provider which is used to timestamps for use in UUIDs with version 7.
 *
 * The output of a value is guaranteed to be monotonically increasing, even if the system clock does not provide sufficient granularity.
 * This is achieved by providing a collision counter value in addition to the epoch timestamp value.
 * It is the obligation of the UUID supplier to reserve enough bits for the counter value and take care of overflows.
